# Sales Performance - AtliQ Mart 

## Project Background & Objectives
**Dataset source and context:** Challenge - 2 (https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge)

## Overview
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers have not extended their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and 'OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer. 

## Key Findings
 1. Surat has comparatively lesser orders, amongst all 3 locations, in the entire 6 months time duration. 
 2. The current performance of 'On-Time-In-Full delivery' measure has the lowest performance at 29.02% for a target of 66%. The In-Full delivery performance against target is 52.78% against 77%; On-Time Delivery is 59.03% against 86%. 
 3. Comparing the Orders Indicators for 3 cities, Ahmedabad has good In-Full delivery performance. Surat has topped the On Time and OTIF delivery performance. While Vadodara has the least performance in all 3 indicators. 
 4. Surat, having less orders, is better able to maintain good performance. Nevertheless, the performance hasnt been sufficient to achieve targets. 
 5. Across all three locations, Dairy is the biggest orderline in quantity.
 6. The Average Line Fill Rate of entire data is 65.96% and Volume Fill rate is 96.59%
 7. Vadodara has as much orders as Ahmedabad, yet has lower Line Fill Rate compared to Ahmedabad and even Surat. 
 8. Although the Line fill rate of all 3 categories are similar, Food has the highest LFR. 
 9. Food has the highest Volume fill rate across all three locations. 

## Strategic Recommendations

1. Considering Vadodara has huge orders and also that it is lower performing of the three locations, AtliQ needs to focus on the improvement of Vadodara's performance on key metrics to improve over all metrics of the business. 

2. AtliQ needs to focus on improving the Infull delivery indicator of: 

Ahmedabad : Sorefoz Mart, Lotus Mart
Surat : Info Stores, Acclaimed stores 
Vadodara : Coolblue, Vijay Stores

3. AtliQ needs to focus on improving the OnTime delivery indicator of: 

Ahmedabad : Acclaimed stores, Lotus Mart
Surat :  Acclaimed stores, Lotus Mart
Vadodara : Lotus Mart, Coolblue, Acclaimed stores

4. AtliQ needs to focus on improving the OTIF delivery indicator of: 

Ahmedabad : Sorefoz Mart, Lotus Mart, Acclaimed stores, Coolblue
Surat :  Acclaimed stores, Info Stores, Lotus Mart
Vadodara : Coolblue, Elite Mart, Vijay Stores, Lotus Mart, Acclaimed stores

5. While improving Line fill rate and Volume Fill rate, in Vadodara, the management has to focus on beverages category. The next priority could be AM Butter in Dairy category. 

6. Overall, some customers have very low percentages of all 3 measures namely., OT, IF, OTIF. These need to be improved on priority. The customers are - Coolblue, Accliamed Stores, Lotus Mart. 

7. Analysing the Product metrics, AM Butter 250 needs to be improved on all product metrics. It has been performing poorly amongst all customers. 

8. There is a need to analyse the cause of low In-Full Delivery % in last week of July and 1st week of August. This is also the time where In-Full delivery touched its all time peak.
